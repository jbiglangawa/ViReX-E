# ViReX-E
Program Codes of ViReX-E Project


Welcome! This is JMBA, the Hardware Designer, programmer, and leader of ViReX-E Development Group.
Together with my other teammates, Ruby, Paul, and Sammy, we built the project ViReX-E!

The name of this project is the abbreviation of "Virtual Reality Exercising Equipment". As the name
suggests, it shows a new way of having fun in Virtual Reality, the new craze of technology at the moment,
and Exercising.

This is the repository of the codes used in the project. Please do use it with proper care. And do not forget
to engrave my name in your project :)
